Projects built while following The [Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook](https://www.manning.com/books/the-little-elixir-and-otp-guidebook). If you don't know OTP, go read it.

### About The Book
_The Little Elixir & OTP Guidebook_ gets you started writing applications with Elixir and OTP. You'll begin with the immediately comfortable Elixir language syntax, along with just enough functional programming to use it effectively. Then, you'll dive straight into several lighthearted examples that teach you to take advantage of the incredible functionality built into the OTP library.
